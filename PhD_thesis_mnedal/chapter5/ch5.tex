\section{Future Work}
The research presented in this thesis establishes an important foundation and provides a precursor for future advances that can build upon the present work. Some open questions and promising areas for future investigations include:

- Additional coronal wave statistical studies using expanded event samples and new imaging datasets from Solar Orbiter and ground observatories to improve generalizability of findings.

- Incorporating 3D analytical and numerical coronal wave propagation models for more physics-based forecasting approaches. 

- Modeling mechanisms for type III radio burst onset and time profiles using particle-in-cell and MHD models. 

- Ensemble forecasting models for SEP events combining multiple machine learning algorithms trained on multi-mission data.

- Validation of data-driven models for other solar wind driven geospace extremes such as radiation belt enhancements and ionospheric storms.

- Leveraging new solar observatory missions and assimilative models within operational prediction systems for real-time space weather forecasts.

- Exploring applications of deep learning and physics-informed machine learning to additional outstanding problems in heliophysics and astrophysics.

In summary, the present work opens exciting avenues for more cross-disciplinary studies synthesizing heliophysics domain knowledge with cutting-edge data science and artificial intelligence methods. The new generation of solar, heliospheric and geospace missions will yield transformative observations to continue advancing both science understanding and predictive capabilities.
